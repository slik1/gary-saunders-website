        <p>Hey there! My name is Gary Saunders and I’m currently a front-end developer in San Marcos, CA. </p>
        <p>I remember dialing up a BBS to exchange games and images as a kid but it wasn’t until around 2005 that I knew I wanted to help build things for the web as my career.</p>
        <p>TBH - I’m not really sure what I am anymore…I was a developer for many years but in the last couple years I’ve been taking on much more UX/UI designing duties all while working with software engineers to get the designs implemented.</p>
