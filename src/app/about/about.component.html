        <p>Howdy! My name is Gary Saunders and Iâ€™m currently a front-end developer in San Marcos, CA. </p>
        <p>I started building websites for the web as a steady profession since around 2007, when I scored a web
            developer opportunity at an action sports marketing agency while still in college.</p>
        <p>Fast forward 14 years and now I'm an advocate for the end user, working with products owners and software
            engineering teams to design and develop software user interfaces for a global leader in the landscape
            lighting and irrigation industry.</p>
